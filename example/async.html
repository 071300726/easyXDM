        The remote implementation is synchronous and will return immediately

        <input type="button" onclick="add(3,5)" value="call addNumbers on remote domain"/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The remote implementation of multiplyNumbers is asynchronous and will return after 5seconds
        <br/>
        This shows that you can use async calls in the remote method, eg. XHR calls<br/>
