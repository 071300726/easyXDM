1.4.0 - 07.08.09
Renamed the library to easyXDM to avoid being associated with the XSS-vulnerability
Alle references to easyXSS can be replaced with easyXDM
The communication protocol has not changed, so easyXDM 1.4.0 is 100% compatible with easyXSS 1.4.0

1.4.0 - 07.08.09
Restructured the implementation of easyXSS.Interface, this now creates its own easyXSS.Channel,
just like easyXSS.Channel creates its own easyXSS.Transport.ITransport.
The internals of this class has also been restructured and should be easier to understand.

Breaking changes:
The easyXSS.Interface constructor now takes the configuration of a channel instead of a ready channel.

1.3.0 - 02.08.09
Restructured the code again sot that it will be easier to understand.
Changed to using the 'new classname' construct instead of easyXSS.createClassname
Added documentation to the examples.

Breaking changes:
Removed several create.. methods. 

1.2
Restructured the code to allow better documentation
Converted most of the code to JsDoc format
The debug version will try to easyXSS.trace all relevant actions to console.info if available
