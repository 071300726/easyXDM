2.2.0 21.04.10
Rpc
	No more isVoid/isAsync
		These are no longer needed as all of this is automatically handled by the RpcBehavior.
	Optional callbacks when calling methods, success, success+error, or none if the remote method does not return data or you just don't care about it
	A shorthand notation for defining local methods, nameOfMethod: function(... instead of nameOfMethod: { method: function(...
	Smaller code base due to a simpler(!) RpcBehavior
	
Overall
	Reduced the public API
		This makes it more manageable for most
	Proper documentation with code examples for Socket and Rpc
	Restructured internal methods so that they are faster and more easy to minify

2.1.0 18.04.10
The Rpc behavior is now using the JSON-PRC 2.0 protocol, and will now also support an error callback.
The Rpc class will also make sure that the serializer being used actually works, and so is not wrecked by the inclusion
of PrototypeJs and other libraries that interferes with HTML5's JSON object. 
The xhr.html file is now completely self-contained and now uses separate callbacks for success and error.
Lots of small changes to improve scope lookup, and to improve minifying the code.


2.0.1 27.03.10
See commit log at github

2.0 18.03.10
Refactored all the transport classes into stack elements.
The transports are now exposed as a single Socket that selects the appropriate stack to initialize based on the available features and config parameters.
Removed the Channel class as this can easily be implemented when needed using the Socket class and JSON.parse/stringify.
Refactored the Interface class and renamed it Rpc as this is more descriptive.
The optional onReady method is now a member of the config argument instead of being a separate one.
Removed the serializing namespace as this was not used internally, and as it can easily be injected when needed.
Renamed the methods for adding and removing events to on and un.
The HashTransport is now only used when access to name.html (old hash.html) is not available.

1.8.0 27.02.10
Both the HashTransport and the Nametransport has received a major overhaul.
Generic Behaviors are now implemented, and deal with reliability (making the HashTransport reliable), queueing and sender verification.
This means that all the transports are now equal when it comes to behavior, the only difference is speed.
They are all reliant, 
they are all able to queue and dispatch messages automatically
they are all secure from spoofing
and they are all easy to use!

With the new behavior architecture it will also be easier to add new functionality
- it might even be that the transport internals will be moved into similar behaviors.  

1.7.5 25.02.10
Made several improvements to the HashTransport - this now verifies that it actually can communicate with the other end
and thereby disables the spoofing the origin (as previously possible).

1.7.4 - 22.02.10
Implemented queing for NameTransport, this also made it more reliable.
This means that all transports now support rapid sending of messages, even within the same js thread.
The tests has also been updated, and from tests that are supposed to fail are now skipped by default. 

1.7.3 - 21.02.10
Fixed NameTransport - for some unknown reason, the implementation released did not work.

1.7.2 - 19.02.10
Applied an important bugfix contributed by Bjorn Blomqvist (http://github.com/bjornblomqvist).
The bug breaks easyXDM under the following conditions
	the host is set up to use the BestAvailableTransport
	the host is set up with local: window (to support HashTransport without hash.html)
	the browser supports postMessage

1.7.1 - 19.02.10
Refactored the transport classes so that all query arguments are namespaced.
This should avoid errors happening due to colliding argument names.
Examples of such errors are when using a wordpress page as the host, as wordpress' p argument (used for paging) would
cause easyXDM to believe it was the provider instead of the consumer (host).

Breaking changes:
As longs as both parties are using the new version no errors will occur.
But this version is unable to communicate with earlier versions.

1.7.0 - 02.02.10
Many adjustments has been made to how the transports select mode and how the BestAvailableTransport selects a transport.
For the host the BestAvailableTransport will pick the best transport dependend on the available features and parameters.
For the guest the BestAvailableTransport will choose the on specified in use by reading the query line.

A new transport, NameTransport has also been introduced, and is now preferred over HashTransport as long as the
correct parameters are set. This is due to its ability to transfer huge amounts of data compared to the HashTransport.
This does on the other hand mean that the host need to specify the location of the remote hash.html.

Breaking changes:
The NameTransport will not work with users who has the old hash.html file, it is therefor adviced that you
rename the hash.html file so that your uses will download the correct version.

1.6.0 - 04.01.10
Added the option to use the already loaded window as the local document for messaging when falling back 
to the HashTransport. This can be done by setting 'local:window' in the transports configuration.
The documentation has also been changed sligtly making it a bit easier to see the necessary configuration attributes
The version is being upped to 1.6 as we now have complete support for scenarios where you are not able to upload
the hash.html file to the local domain, something I think is a big step forward.

1.5.5 - 02.01.10
For scenarios where you are unable to place hash.html on the local domain, you can now
set the local attribute to point at any file available on the domain, like robots.txt or favicon.ico,
and set the readyAfter attribute to when you want the library to transition to the ready state. 
It is important that the local file has had time to load before this.

1.5.4 - 11.11.09
easyXDM.Interface can now take an new configuration parameter, 'serializer'.
This will be used instead of the JSON object if present and has to implement the same signature as the JSON object.
This is to enable users to use serializing methods present in their main framework. 
Users of prototypejs will have to use this to override the serializer using the following serializer object
{
	stringify(obj){
		return Object.toJSON(obj);
	},
	parse(str){
		return str.evalJSON();
	}
}
This is due to prototypejs adding the toJSON method to Array.prototype which causes the native JSON object to fail.

The test suite has also been fixed so that it doesnt crash WebKit.

1.5.3 - 06.09.09
The transports now support using remote urls containing query parameters.
Added the easyXDM.apply method, and also easyXMD.WidgetManager and easyXDM.Widget.
The widget classes makes it extremely easy to support widgets.

1.5.2 - 29.08.09
Modified the HashTransport to using the resize event to trigger new messages to be read.
This is a lot faster and less resource consuming than polling.
For iframes placed in a container we still use polling so that we don't disturbe the layout.
Added a test suite.

1.5.1 - 17.08.09
Namespaces are now in lowercase. This makes it easier to distinguish between classes
and namespaces.
Refactored the createFrame method as we do no longer require the ability to name frames.
Took away passing the version as a parameter to hash.html, versioning should be handled 
by renaming the file or by other means.

Breaking changes:
Namespaces changed to all lowercase letters.

1.5.0 - 08.08.09
Restructured the HashTransport so that all dependencies are contained in one class.
Also removed the need to use the fragile window.open(.. method to get a reference
to the window to read from.
hash.html is now called with the version as a parameter. This should help to avoid the cached
version being used accross version changes.
Breaking changes:
hash.html calls a new method with a new signature.

1.4.0 - 07.08.09
Renamed the library to easyXDM to avoid being associated with the XSS-vulnerability
Alle references to easyXSS can be replaced with easyXDM
The communication protocol has not changed, so easyXDM 1.4.0 is 100% compatible with easyXSS 1.4.0

1.4.0 - 07.08.09
Restructured the implementation of easyXSS.Interface, this now creates its own easyXSS.Channel,
just like easyXSS.Channel creates its own easyXSS.Transport.ITransport.
The internals of this class has also been restructured and should be easier to understand.

Breaking changes:
The easyXSS.Interface constructor now takes the configuration of a channel instead of a ready channel.

1.3.0 - 02.08.09
Restructured the code again sot that it will be easier to understand.
Changed to using the 'new classname' construct instead of easyXSS.createClassname
Added documentation to the examples.

Breaking changes:
Removed several create.. methods. 

1.2
Restructured the code to allow better documentation
Converted most of the code to JsDoc format
The debug version will try to easyXSS.trace all relevant actions to console.info if available

Breaking changes:
The method called by hash.html has moved.
