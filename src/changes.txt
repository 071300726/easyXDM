1.5.3 - 06.09.09
The transports now support using remote urls containing query parameters.
Added the easyXDM.apply method, and also easyXMD.WidgetManager and easyXDM.Widget.
The widget classes makes it extremely easy to support widgets.

1.5.2 - 29.08.09
Modified the HashTransport to using the resize event to trigger new messages to be read.
This is a lot faster and less resource consuming than polling.
For iframes placed in a container we still use polling so that we don't disturbe the layout.
Added a test suite.

1.5.1 - 17.08.09
Namespaces are now in lowercase. This makes it easier to distinguish between classes
and namespaces.
Refactored the createFrame method as we do no longer require the ability to name frames.
Took away passing the version as a parameter to hash.html, versioning should be handled 
by renaming the file or by other means.

Breaking changes:
Namespaces changed to all lowercase letters.

1.5.0 - 08.08.09
Restructured the HashTransport so that all dependencies are contained in one class.
Also removed the need to use the fragile window.open(.. method to get a reference
to the window to read from.
hash.html is now called with the version as a parameter. This should help to avoid the cached
version being used accross version changes.
Breaking changes:
hash.html calls a new method with a new signature.

1.4.0 - 07.08.09
Renamed the library to easyXDM to avoid being associated with the XSS-vulnerability
Alle references to easyXSS can be replaced with easyXDM
The communication protocol has not changed, so easyXDM 1.4.0 is 100% compatible with easyXSS 1.4.0

1.4.0 - 07.08.09
Restructured the implementation of easyXSS.Interface, this now creates its own easyXSS.Channel,
just like easyXSS.Channel creates its own easyXSS.Transport.ITransport.
The internals of this class has also been restructured and should be easier to understand.

Breaking changes:
The easyXSS.Interface constructor now takes the configuration of a channel instead of a ready channel.

1.3.0 - 02.08.09
Restructured the code again sot that it will be easier to understand.
Changed to using the 'new classname' construct instead of easyXSS.createClassname
Added documentation to the examples.

Breaking changes:
Removed several create.. methods. 

1.2
Restructured the code to allow better documentation
Converted most of the code to JsDoc format
The debug version will try to easyXSS.trace all relevant actions to console.info if available

Breaking changes:
The method called by hash.html has moved.
